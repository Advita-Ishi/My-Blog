                    The Bhavan's Old Students' Society (BOSS) made a kind donation to Open Eyes Foundation, Chandigarh yesterday as they gave away academic books to help students from lesser privileged backgrounds. Mrs. Vineeta Arora, Sr. Principal, and Vice Principal, Mrs. Suparna Bansal, along with BOSS President Mr. Vinay Aggarwal, Vice president Ms. Richa Gupta and Executive Member Mr. Keshav Garg, donated academic books that would help over 100 underprivileged children during their academic session.

The donation was made to Mr. Sandeep Kumar, who runs open Eyes Foundation, an NGO established to help underprivileged children through the donation of old books, stationery, and goods. The foundation partners with other institutions to tackle problems and sensitize students towards various pressing issues. Bhavan Vidyalaya’s Alumni were happy to partake in this endeavor which provides much-needed resources to underprivileged students. The books donated were in good condition and the NGO hopes that they can be used for at least four academic sessions.

This drive was amongst the various philanthropic activities undertaken by BOSS this year. The school’s Old Students’ Society has successfully undertaken a host of philanthropic activities this year. They had donated PPE kits to doctors, ration to the needy at Bapu Dham Colony, chocolates to Corona warriors among other endeavors. Their recent endeavor KOSHISH provides financial aid to patients, who need medical help and invasive procedures like heart surgery, etc.

Sr. Principal Ms. Vineeta Arora appreciated the efforts made by BOSS, a one-of-its-kind alumni network, which has sincerely committed itself to the betterment of the society they live in, truly exemplifying the fundamental values of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.
